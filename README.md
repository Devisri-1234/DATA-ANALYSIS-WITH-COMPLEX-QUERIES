# DATA-ANALYSIS-WITH-COMPLEX-QUERIES

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTION

*NAME*: DEVISRI.S

*INTERN ID*: CT04DF1284

*DOMAIN*: SQL

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: 📝 Task Description:
As part of the internship, this task focused on applying complex SQL queries to analyze data beyond basic SELECT and JOIN operations. The goal was to derive business insights by leveraging advanced SQL capabilities, which are often used in real-world data analytics and reporting.

The following techniques were used:

🔹 Window Functions:
Used to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Examples include RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() OVER(), and AVG() OVER() for identifying trends like top-performing products or cumulative totals.

🔹 Subqueries:
Embedded queries used inside other queries to filter, compute, or transform data before applying additional logic. Examples include filtering results based on aggregated conditions (WHERE value > (SELECT AVG(...))).

🔹 Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
Temporary result sets defined using the WITH clause to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into modular, readable blocks.

💻 Tools Used:
OneCompiler.com (SQL) – A reliable and user-friendly online SQL compiler used to write, test, and debug queries in a simulated environment without the need for local database installations.

Online SQL Playground Tools – For writing and testing advanced SQL logic quickly and visualizing results instantly.

📊 Deliverables:
A set of SQL scripts demonstrating the use of window functions, CTEs, and subqueries.

Generated result tables showcasing data trends, rankings, aggregations, and patterns.

Screenshots of query outputs and explanations for each logic block used in the queries.

A brief report summarizing insights discovered during the analysis.
